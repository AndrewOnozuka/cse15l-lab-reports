3. After you have installed VScode, you're ready to go!

## Remotely Connecting

1. Open a new terminal in VScode by going to the top of your screen and selecting "Terminal" -> "New Terminal".

2. Then type: "ssh cs15lsp22xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu"

*make sure you replace the xxx with your unique three letter sequence! also make sure the quarter info is updated, it says sp22 as it is spring 2022 when this lab report is being written*
3. This should then prompt you for a password.
