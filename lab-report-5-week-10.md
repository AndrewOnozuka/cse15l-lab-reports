# Lab Report 5 | Week 10

## Finding Differences Between Two Text Files

I found the tests with different results using the following command:

```
vimdiff my-markdown-parser/results.txt markdown-parser/results.txt
```

As we can see in the picture below, we can see which tests produced different results.

![]()

I decided to take a look at files 201 and 342.

## Link to Test Files

Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository , either is fine)

For each test:
Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).
