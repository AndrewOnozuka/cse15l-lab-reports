In this lab report, you will implement all Group Choice Options (1-3) from Lab 5. Complete them for yourself (if you havenâ€™t already), and take the relevant screenshots listed below. Create a post with a few sentences of description about all the options available.

# Lab Report 3 | Week 6

## Background

In this lab report, we implement all of the group choice options from Lab 5. The link can be found below:

## Streamlining ssh Configuration

- Show your .ssh/config file, and how you edited it (with VScode, another program, etc)

To edit my .ssh/config file, I opened up the built-in terminal (as I am on Mac).

As you can see, I typed:

```
cd ~/.ssh           # change directory
ls -a               # list all
cat config          # to see the contents of config
vim config          # to edit config
```

After typing the last vim command, your screen should turn into something like this:

To edit the file, press the "i" key (insert) and then make your changes. Once you are done, press the "esc" key (escape) and type ":wq" then press "enter". This will bring you back to the terminal. After these changes, you should be able to directly log on with a shorter ssh command:

If we edit the first line of the config file after "Host", we can actually use whatever phrase we want. Below is an example:

```
ssh lr3ex           # lab report 3 example
```

This updates shortened alias is helpful with other commands as well. Here is an example of using an scp command to move a file:

## Setup Github Access from ieng6

Your public key should be stored as a "id_rsa.pub" file as seen below:

![Screenshot](https://github.com/andrewonozuka/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/screenshots-lr3/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-06%20at%2012.45.36.png?raw=true)

Your private key should be stored as a "id_rsa" file as seen below:

![Screenshot](https://github.com/andrewonozuka/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/screenshots-lr3/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-06%20at%2012.38.08.png?raw=true)

You can also use git commands to add, commit, and push changes to Github through the terminal using these commands:

```
git add lab-report-3-week-6.md
git commit lab-report-3-week-6.md
git push
```

Here's what it looks like on Github:

## Copy whole directories with scp -r

- Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account.
- Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository.
- Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.

[Failure Inducing Input: test-file3.md](https://github.com/andrewonozuka/markdown-parser/edit/main/test-file3.md)

While we addressed the issue of the infinite loop earlier, our solution only had an if and else if statement. Because it was missing the last else statement, it was not properly returning the expected output.

Failing Output #3:

![Failing Output #3](https://github.com/andrewonozuka/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-01%20at%2005.07.20.png?raw=true)

The bug was with input lines that were missing parenthesis. Once we added the last else statement so that all cases were covered, we were able to successfully ignore the faulty lines of input and only return the valid links.

Passing Output #3:

## Final Review

After all of our code changes, this is what our code now looks like:

```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MarkdownParse {

    public static ArrayList<String> getLinks(String markdown) {
        ArrayList<String> toReturn = new ArrayList<>();
        // find the next [, then find the ], then find the (, then read link upto next )
        int currentIndex = 0;
        while(currentIndex < markdown.length()) {
            int openBracket = markdown.indexOf("[", currentIndex);
            int closeBracket = markdown.indexOf("]", openBracket);
            int openParen = markdown.indexOf("(", closeBracket);
            int closeParen = markdown.indexOf(")", openParen);

            if (openBracket == -1 || closeBracket == -1 || openParen == -1 || closeParen == -1) {
                currentIndex = markdown.length();
                break; // prevents infinite loop
            } else if (closeBracket + 1 == openParen && openBracket != -1) {
                if (markdown.indexOf("\n", openBracket) < closeParen) {
                    currentIndex = closeParen;
                } else if (markdown.charAt(openBracket - 1) == '!') {
                    currentIndex = closeParen + 1; 
                } else {
                    toReturn.add(markdown.substring(openParen + 1, closeParen));
                    currentIndex = closeParen + 1;
                }
            } else {
                toReturn.add(markdown.substring(openParen + 1, closeParen));
                currentIndex = closeParen + 1;
            }
        }
        return toReturn;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path fileName = Path.of(args[0]);
        String content = Files.readString(fileName);
        ArrayList<String> links = getLinks(content);
        System.out.println(links);
    }
}
```
